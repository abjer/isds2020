    "# Session 10: Introduction to modeling and machine learning\n",
    "In this combined teaching module and exercise set you will get an introduction to modeling using data. We proceed with introducing machine learning, and will get your first taste of how machine learning algorithms are constructed. You will implement a [_perceptron_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) from scratch using the matrix-algebra library NumPy. We will train this model on the iris data to predict flower types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the concepts both programming-wise and related to machine learning are probably new to most of you - don't be afraid to ask questions about either, as much of this lecture/exercise set lays the foundation for the upcoming sessions. \n",

    "The structure of the notebook is that the beginning will contain a lot of lecturing material. However, towards the end you will find a few exercises. To a few of you, there may be some new mathematical terms - I have tried to provide som references where you can study these more. However, the focus should be on understanding the high-level concepts rather than machine learning. Raschka's chapter 2 is also excellent companion for this module.\n",

# Guide to preparations
It is necessary that you time preparing for the course. We expect that you have spent 30-50 hours on learning basic Python before we begin teaching. In particular you should do the following (prioritized order):

1. [Install anaconda and other software](/post/install)
2. Install nbgrader with anaconda (write `pip install nbgrader` in the terminal/prompt)
3. Open Assignment 0 in Jupyter notebook, [see this guide](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks) on how to open and use a notebook
4. Work on Assignment 0 - try to solve as much as possible
5. When you get stuck then follow the trouble shooting guidline below - start with a) and move to d)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>see material below for learning Python - make sure you have read all material about the relevant problem</li>
    <li>search on Google, in particular stackexchange is very useful</li>
    <li>ask other people, you may already now other Python experts</li>
    <li>open a GitHub issue in our [ISDS2020 repository](https://github.com/abjer/isds2020)</li>
    </ol>
6. If you have extra time you can familiarize yourself with your operating system (OS), i.e. Windows/Mac/Linux. In particular, learn the basics of working in the terminal/command prompt.


## Assignment 0
In preparation for the course you are expected to hand in an assignment in Python before lectures begin. This assignment is intended to ensure that you all know some basic python when you begin the summer school.
The assignment will be posted on github and Absalon on July 15, and must also be handed in via Absalon no later than **Sunday August 11th**.

The assignment is **individual**. You are welcome to discuss answers with others. The answers you provide in the assignment will be used to **place you into groups**, see [practical info](/page/practical) for details. Your
group members will be randomly selected among those who performed approximately equally well on assignment 0.


## Material for learning Python

We have included three different online resources. All of the three online resources are great and self-contained for learning python and you should choose the one suits you most. They will you to learn the necessary skills for answering the questions.

**A series of youtube videos:** [pythonprogramming.net fundamental](https://pythonprogramming.net/python-fundamental-tutorials/) (basics and intermediate)

**A tutorial website:** [The official python 3 tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) (sections 3, 4 and 5)

**A book:** [learn python the hard way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

You are free to pick from either of the above, or find your own resources online. A very good (but perhaps slightly confusing) approach to learning anything programming related is to simply search google whenever you have a question, or cannot get your code to run. In 99% of the cases the first or second result will contain an answer to your question, and this saves you the time required to look for the right pages in a book, or the right tutorial on some website.

For those of you who find it difficult to learn from online resources we offer a workshop and way to ask us questions:

**A workshop**: We will host a workshop on **Aug 06 at 16:00** where we cover the skills required to answer this problem set. You can ask questions here.

Remember to ask questions through the GitHub issues in our [ISDS2020 repository](https://github.com/abjer/isds2020/issues)!

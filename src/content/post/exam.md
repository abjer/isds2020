When the teaching in our course finishes you are to hand in a project. The formal requirements are found [here](page/practical/) along with details on grading. The exam period runs from August 23, 2019 from 15 PM to August 30 at 15 PM.

In this blog post we want to expand a little bit on how a good project will look. The focus of the project is to pose and interesting question to data that can be collected publicly and attempt to answer it.

We emhasize that some good projects use machine learning for modelling a variable of interest, while some good projects use machine learning to parse text data. When using machine learning we DO NOT EXPECT that you use any tools beyond this course, i.e. other than logistic and linear regression with regularization. Other projects are great without even using machine learning, by collecting and structuring interesting or challenging data and providing descriptive statistic and good visualizations. Therefore, you should always ask yourself: what does modelling an outcome provide of value? is it interesting? Some of the best project simply visualize data and demonstrate a good understanding through visualization and descriptive statistics.

We also note that a good project is succinct and to the point. You should describe your data structuring at a high level to convey what you have done. Sometimes many hundred lines of complicated code can be stated quite briefly to get the essence.

On the internal page on Absalon [here](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/44054), we will make make some of projects from earlier years available. As you can see they span quite different subject, writing styles and use of machine learning.
